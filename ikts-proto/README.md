# IKTS 2017 - Multi Game Prototype

### Authors - Paul Stanfield/Stephen Hutchinson

#### Running Locally 

- jekyll serve --baseurl ''

#### Prep for FTP to Preview Server 

- kill server with "ctrl+c"

- jekyll build

- Copy the contents of the "_site" folder to the relevant preview folder

- To rerun locally run jekyll serve --baseurl '' again

#### Developers 

- Take from the "_site" folder for development, although if its easier for you to take from the other folders depending on you're project structure then thats good too, as then we could possibly use SCSS on the development build - Ping me on skype/paul.stanfield@sportsfusion.eu if you've any questions
